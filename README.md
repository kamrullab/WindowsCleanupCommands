## **Important Notes** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Registry Cleanup**: Be cautious when manually deleting registry keys. Deleting the wrong entries can affect system stability. **Always back up your system or registry** before performing cleanup operations.
- **System Restore**: It‚Äôs generally a good idea to keep some system restore points, as they can be useful for troubleshooting in case something goes wrong.

For safer, more automated solutions, consider using third-party tools like **CCleaner** or **Revo Uninstaller**.
